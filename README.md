Getting-Started-Series
======================

Series of presentations to introduce people to useful technologies (Python, LaTeX, Git,
R). Presentations involve participants following along on their laptops.

A LaTeX beamer theme for these talks will be added later. For now, you can just use the
default beamer theme.
